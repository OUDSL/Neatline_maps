### What is Neatline?
Neatline is an Omeka Plugin that allows you to create a navigatable map with data points and/or outlined regions.
## Starting a Neatline Map
* Download the Neatline Plugin from Omeka and install it to your site as outlined in the *OU Create & Omeka* guide.
* Under the ***Neatline*** tab in your admin dashboard, select ***Exhibit Settings***.
* Create a title and a URL slug for your map. You can also include a narrative for the page, and select the type of map that appears in your neatline: Street Map, Terrain Map, Satellite Map etc.
Check the box to make your Neatline ***Public*** and save the changed to the page.
## Building a Neatline Map
* Select the title of your map from the Neatline tab in the admin page.
* Now is where you get creative in constructing your map: Each time you want to create a new data point, line, or polygon-enclosed region, select ***New Record***.
* For each record you create, you will create a URL slug, a Title for the record, and a description of the record.
 * To include photographs or links within the title or body text of your record, select ***Edit HTML*** to gain access to these editing details.
* The *Item* tab for your record allows you to link your record directly to an item from your Omeka site; like a picture or a text document for example. Doing this will allow the Neatline map to access the informational data on the item for viewers to see.
* The *Map* tab is where you create your points/lines/shapes. Remember to save all geometry changes before navigating away from the map tab.
* The *Style* tab is where you can alter the appearance of your points/lines/shapes: changing the color, the thickness, the opacity, and etc.
* ***Help Note*** If you need additional help/explanation of a specific feature of Neatline, select the ***?*** button next to the aspect you have a question about for further instruction.
